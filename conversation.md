Client: We’re interested in the proposal, but the pricing seems a bit higher than expected. Can we negotiate?

Sales Rep: I understand your concern. While our rates reflect the quality of service, we can offer a 10% discount for
long-term contracts.

Client: That sounds better, but we were hoping for something more in the 15% range.

Sales Rep: Let me speak with my manager and see what we can do. I’ll get back to you by the end of the day.

Client: Thank you. We look forward to hearing from you.
